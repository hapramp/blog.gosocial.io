Art is a splendid way of expressing your creativity and imagination. But, there are times when you can find it becoming monotonous and boring. You could be struggling with a particular technique or encounter an art block. This is quite common in the art community.

A very efficient way to combat this is by taking challenges. The best part about art challenges is its accessibility. For an experienced artist, an art challenge serves as a medium to find inspiration. While others can take part to get their creative juices flowing.

The web is swarming with many challenges. For your ease, we have created a list of the 10 best creative art challenges that you must take.

**1. Inktober**

[Inktober ](https://inktober.com/)is the most well known on our list of art challenges. Artist Jake Parker designed it in 2009. The idea was to improve his inking skills and to develop productive drawing habits using a fun way. He shared his method with other artists and invited them to join him. Soon, it became one of the most popular art challenges among the art communities all over the world.

There are two standard ways to take the Inktober challenge. Inktober Classic is making 31 drawings in 31 days. You take this challenge in October as you may have guessed by now.

The other version is Inktober 52 and is the slower-paced version of the classic Inktober. In this mode, you make one drawing a week for 52 weeks, through the year.

You have to make your drawings in ink and post them on any social media platform with #inktober. We recommend sharing it on artist-friendly platforms like [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/), and [GoSocial](https://www.getgosocial.app/). If you are stuck, you can get help in the form of prompts on the Inktober website.

The best part about Inktober is that the rules suit the lifestyle of artists , and help them get better. Because of its flexible guidelines, Inktober is one of the best art challenges for beginners. You can choose to take it whenever you want and work on the prompts of your liking. You can even ink on digital mediums, which is a cool improvisation for the digital art creators out there.

**2. Food Art Challenge**

This is one of the most interesting art challenges you can take. Food and art have complemented each other for centuries. And what can be a better way to make a glorious piece of art that you can relish afterward?

The best way to do this is to cook any dish that you would like, no matter how complex or simple it is. The challenge begins when you start plating what you made. Assume that the plate is your canvas, and decide the composition. Once that's done, start adding the dish you cooked, to the plate.

Give your food a new dimension. You can make it look like a character, a landscape, or even recreate a famous painting in your own unique style. The only rule is that everything on your plate must be edible. This is one of the most fun, creative, and fruitful art challenges that you can try at home. Go nuts with it! (Pun intended)

The [Food Art Challenge](https://getgosocial.app/blog/2020-05-16-Food-Art-Challenge/) is hosted on GoSocial. [GoSocial ](https://www.getgosocial.app/)is a social media app for artists. Here, you can take challenges, track your, and build a community of like-minded artists.

**3. Letter The Lyric**

There is no doubt that music makes a lasting impression. The impact of the pair of good lyrics and melodious beats can be long-lasting. We have got a challenge for those who can resonate with that sentence.

In this art challenge, you play with the lyrics of your choice. All you need for this are sketches and a piece of paper. Now pen down the lyrics that you have playing in your mind in your choice of typography. This art challenge is a great way of understanding the authority of texts and drama of fonts.

You could also put your own spin on it. Instead of regular sketches, use calligraphy pens or brush to frame the lyrics. Currently, [GoSocial ](https://www.getgosocial.app/)is hosting [this challenge ](https://getgosocial.app/blog/2020-05-16-Letter-the-Lyric-Art-Challenge/)on its app. If you still don't know how to go about it, you can check out what other artists have created.

Take any of your completed artwork from the past. This artwork can be an intense portrait, a goofy sketch, or your favorite character. We recommend choosing a picture that you drew during the initial stages of your journey as an artist. Now, draw the same thing again, and compare the two drawings side by side. You can add details or change the base colors.

**6. Coffee Art Challenge**

This is one of the more offbeat art challenges to do at home. You may have seen latte art presented in a cup, but this is a fun twist on coffee art, in which you use coffee to paint on paper. Painting with coffee can be surprisingly fulfilling once you start.

If you are a caffeine enthusiast, you may already know how to brew your coffee to make different shades of color. If you’re new to coffee, that’s fine too. You can experiment with it by boiling black coffee or adding milk to lighten the tone. You can learn how to control the saturation and texture of the coffee to use it as paint.
