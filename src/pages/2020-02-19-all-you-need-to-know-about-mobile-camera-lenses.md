Two decades ago who would have believed that we will have the power of a high-end camera on our mobile device? Probably no one? Yet, now we have smartphones with advanced and high-end camera features. That means if anyone wants to begin photography, he doesn’t necessarily need to buy a camera. Many times it is said that “The best camera is the one that you have with you.” Along with that, if at any point, you feel that you want some extra power and features in the lenses of your mobile’s camera, then you can make use of the Mobile Camera Lens. Although it is not that easy to understand the capabilities and nuances of the mobile camera lens, still it is necessary to grow as a photographer. Here, in this article, we will discuss what is a mobile camera lens and what are different types of mobile lenses available.



# What is a Mobile Camera Lens?

The basic purpose of a lens is directing the light and enhancing the quality of the finished shot. However, most of the phones have tiny lenses and these lenses allow only a small amount of light to go in. Apart from that, most of the phones only have digital zoom. If you take photography seriously, you will use it very less or never. Digital zoom just scales up the picture and you will end up taking a pixelated image that won’t be much different from the cropped photo taken without zoom. These are some key reasons why you should be considering a smartphone camera lens to overcome the certain limitations your phone just can’t get over. In such cases, an extra mobile camera lens plays a vital role. A wide-angle lens with a lower aperture helps any photographer to capture really good landscapes and portrait images.



# Types of Mobile Camera Lenses:

There are various kinds of lenses with a different purpose. When beginning with mobile photography, it is very crucial to know the difference between these lenses. Here is the thorough list:



## WIDE ANGLE PHONE LENS

A wide-angle mobile camera lens is ideal for landscape, cityscape, or portrait photography. If you want to sweep the landscape, a row of friends’ faces, or a cramped and cluttered corner office with immaculate clarity, a wide-angle lens is perfect for you. With a wide-angle lens, you can fit more into your photos while being able to shoot almost anything. The major idea behind the wide-angle lens is to decrease the aperture to increase the depth of field of the image. As a result, when this decrease in opening and increase in depth of field occurs, the snap is captured



## TELEPHOTO PHONE LENS

Typically, any lens is considered as “telephoto lens” if it has a focal length greater than 60mm. A telephoto mobile camera lens is ideal for wild photography and sports photography. This is because this lens helps you to capture the moments from a distance with a crisp and clean photo. In such a case, you don’t need to rely on your phone’s digital zoom feature. A telephoto lens makes the subject appear closer than they are and that is the reason why this lens is perfect for both sports and wildlife photographers.

A telephoto lens is a perfect choice when the subject is far away. In that case, you will be able to magnify the content in your frame without zooming. 



## FISHEYE PHONE LENS

If you want to be a creative photographer then you must try shooting with the fisheye mobile camera lens at least once. These lenses are ideal for the artistic pursuits, extreme sports, and landscapes. Many professional photographers call a fisheye lens an ultra or super-wide lens.  This is because the fisheye lens is an ultra-wide-angle lens that produces strong visual distortion intended to create a wide panoramic or hemispherical image. There are two types of fisheye lenses - a circular and a full-frame. 



## MACRO PHONE LENS

A macro phone camera lens is the ideal lens for macro photography, close-ups, and portraits where the depth of field is minimal. If you are interested in macro photography, you must have this lens. Macro photography is the different style of photography in which you will be taking extreme close-up photos usually of very small subjects. 

Since you take photos of very small subjects, the lens will be helping in magnification of the subject. There is a term “magnification ratio” that tells you how the image projected on the camera’s sensor as compared with the actual size of the subject. That means a lens with a 1:2 ratio can project an image on its sensor up to half the size of the subject while a lens with a 5:1 ratio can project an image five times the size of the object.



**So,** this was all about the smartphone camera lens. Hopefully, your knowledge about the mobile camera lens must be better than it was at the start of this guide. If you want to start mobile photography, having a mobile camera lens in your arsenal opens up your mobile photography to a whole new world of possibilities. If you are a beginner and want to improve your photos or you are a professional photographer looking to diversify your options, then you must try a mobile camera lens. So, find the lens that is most useful and suitable for you and begin your mobile photography journey.
