**1. Get your art into galleries**

As an artist, you know that this is easier said than done. But, it is a great way to increase visibility for your art and make money as an artist. Art galleries put your art in front of a large audience and do the business for you.

But, how do you get into one? It is not enough to just send unsolicited emails and show up at galleries expecting to be noticed immediately. Find the right gallery that suits your style and experience. Once youâ€™ve zeroed down on a gallery, the next step is to network. Follow them on social media, go to their events, understand, and appreciate their work. Engaging with them is a very critical step. Next, pay attention to the submission guidelines and submit the pieces that comply.

You can also reach out to online art galleries. It has been reported that galleries all over the world are seeing a steady rise in online art sales. [Saatchi Art](https://www.saatchiart.com/), [Artfinder](https://www.artfinder.com/), and [Degree Art](https://www.degreeart.com/) are some highly reputed online galleries that can help you make money as an artist by giving you up to 67 percent of the sales price.
