Do you love exploring new places and capturing their beauty for the world to see? Then these unprecedented times may have made you restless and dismayed. Although the world is slowly returning back to its original pace, it is safer to stay in for some more time.

We understand that as a photographer the indoors are not as friendly as the outdoors. Getting distressed about how this is hampering your photo skills is only natural.

But, hey! Inspiration is everywhere. What if we told you could work on your photography in the safety and comfort of your own home? That’s right! You have everything you need to click fantastic photos, right there in your house. There are plenty of exciting and creative photography tricks that you can try without having to step out. Here is our list of the best 10 creative photography challenges to try indoors.

**1. Water Splash Photography**

A creative photography trick that will let you take stunning photographs. Let’s start off with water drop art. You can take a bowl, tray or any dish filled with water. Get a water dropper or a suspended water container to release droplets of water onto the dish below.

Keep in mind that every prop that you use in this shoot matters significantly. Right from the colour of the dish to the viscosity of the liquid, explore different options and see which produces the best result for you. In fact, more viscous liquids like milk and ink work even better to give some spectacular photos. You can try mixing the water with different food colours and dyes to give your photos a vibrant pop of colour. Here are some technical, creative photography tips and tricks to help you pull this off with ease.

* Keep the ISO low.
* Use a fast shutter speed and large aperture.
* Take the pictures up close and use a deep depth of field so that the entire frame remains in focus.
* Try to dim natural light as much as you can and use soft, artificial lights.

Take this to the next level by dropping objects into the water and clicking the splashes they cause. Click pictures at different positions and angles until you get the perfect shot with the right lighting effect. Take [Water Drop Photography Challenge](https://gosocial.io/challenge/water-splash-photography-challenge) on GoSocial and share it with your community.

**2. Camera Toss**

As dubious as it sounds, this is a very creative photography trick. This will also help you understand the basics of kinetic photography. Here are some ways that you can utilise this creative photography trick to click some surreal and cool photos to flaunt.

* Try this in a dark room that has only one light source.
* Set the shutter speed of your camera to one second. This is roughly the amount of time your camera will be suspended in the air. When the timer is up, toss it, and of course the most obviously crucial part, catch it!
* When you are trying this the first few times, use an inexpensive camera and make sure you practice with great caution, until you are thoroughly familiar with throwing and catching your camera. Once you are better at this, you can try to add more light sources and even flip your camera as you let go of it.
* Just to be extra safe, stand over a soft landing spot like a bed or couch to cushion the fall in case you drop it.

**3. Make your own Lightbox**

A lightbox is a great photography tool. It plays a huge role in professional and product photography. Attributing to its indispensable role in many different photography fields, it is also quite expensive. However, you can just make your own lightbox right at home with a few creative photography tips and tricks. All you need is a cardboard box, thick white paper or cloth, and a table lamp.

* Choose a bigger box to widen the range of objects you can click once you’re done.
* Cut off the top flaps of the box and stand it on one end. Mark and cut windows in either side of the box and line them with your thick sheets of white paper.
* Use tape to hold the paper or fabric in place, covering the windows of your box.
* Now place a lamp on one or both sides to shed light on any object that you put inside your lightbox.

**4. Fine art food photography**

[This](https://gosocial.io/challenge/flat-lay-food-photography-challenge) is one of the most creative photography tricks you can try with your brand new lightbox. All you need is a knife and some fruits or vegetables. Say you choose an onion. Cut it into very thin slices. Position your camera directly above the slice and click away. Now, if you would rather go for a dark, subtle tone for your food photography, you can skip the lightbox and just use any background you like. Switch it up with the props and tools of your choice, to get the best out of this shoot. Here are some tips to remember when you try food photography.

* Side lighting or side backlighting is the best choice. Front lighting might cause unappealing shadows.
* Use reflectors to bounce light on your subject and diffusers to soften it.
* When trying a dark artistic style, use black foam core to create shadows where you like.

* Increase your ISO so that you can shoot with a fast shutter speed and minimise the camera shake as much as you can.
