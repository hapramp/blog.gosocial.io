We have a list of the 5 best photography challenges for beginners. These challenges will help you tackle your shortcomings. With these challenges, you can master fundamentals like minimizing camera shake, changing your perspective, and post-processing. Once you are familiar with these basics, you can also experiment and learn about semi-advanced concepts like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.

**1.** [**Vintage Theme-Flatlay Photography Challenge**](https://getgosocial.app/blog/2020-07-31-Vintage-Theme-Flatlay-Photography-Challenge/)****

This is one of the best photography challenges for beginners to try. It is a combination of two chic trends that will help you get the hang of certain techniques and styles. In this challenge, you lay objects on a flat surface like wooden tables, floors, cloth, or even paper. Since this challenge is vintage themed, the objects you use must remind viewers of the past. A simple way to do this is with easy every-day things like books, stationary or pages.

 The aim here is to click a “bird’s eye view” of a vintage setting. Flatlay is a great concept that works for this challenge. This is a great photography challenge for beginners to get as creative as possible with a theme. You could make use of a classic typewriter, spectacles, pens, and beverages. You could even use one or more bright flowers to create a contrast and give your photos a lovely pop of color.

**2.**  [**Monochrome Photography Challenge**](https://getgosocial.app/blog/2020-07-27-Monochrome-Photography-Challenge/)****

 In this challenge, all the colors in your image belong to the same family. In other words, the photograph has one dominant color with varying amounts of light and hues throughout the image. This is one of the best photography challenges for beginners. You can do this naturally or through post-shoot editing. The idea here is not to get a visually accurate photo but to tell a story in an aesthetically pleasing way.

 You can learn how to make your photos dramatic, bold, and distinct. And, monochrome photography is not limited only to black-and-white photography. While the neutral grey tones like sepia and cyan can give your photo a classic, timeless appearance, you can also try other colors for this challenge. This photography challenge gives beginners a chance to experiment and form their own style of photography.

This is one of the best creative takes on photography methods and challenges the creativity of beginners as well as skilled photographers. In this challenge, you layer two different exposures in one image. This way, you blend two pictures into a single distinct one. Although this challenge is more advanced than the others on the list, it is a highly rewarding photography challenge, especially for beginners to master.

 It creates a surreal and cinematic effect for your pictures. You can take photographs for the challenge on your digital camera. Set it on a tripod and use flash to underexpose your subject. Alternatively, you can use the “Blend mode” on Photoshop. This allows you to layer your exposures and adjust saturation and contrast levels.

 Once you are familiar with how to create this effect, you can even try more than two exposures in one image. While it takes time and practice to refine the image, the result is almost always phenomenal.
