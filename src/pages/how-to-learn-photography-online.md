No one can become a pro snapper in a single day. Things take time. If any plan or something other is not working for you, you need to change the plan not your goal. So, remember the 2 Ps - Passion and Patience while learning photography.



## Learn The Fundamentals

Before holding your gear, first, you need to learn some fundamentals of photography. Learn about your camera, its advantages, and its limitations. You need to understand how the camera works and other terminologies, like aperture, focus, shutter speed, ISO, exposure triangle, histogram, rule of thirds, shooting modes, and most importantly, types of photography. Once you have gone through the fundamentals, you are ready to move forward. Now, you can start capturing shots. Although you can keep shooting whatever you like, still it will be better if you choose your niche for specialization.



## Practice

Keep in mind that nothing could help you more than your experience and experience comes with only practice. Irrespective of which photography tutorials you study, which school you go, or how many books or blogs you read, you will have to practice to unlock your snapping skills and style. So, carry your camera everywhere you go and keep shooting whatever you like.

## Draw Inspiration From Others

Once you have joined the photographer’s community and followed your favorite ones, then it’s time to draw inspiration from their work. Finding inspiration is very important as this guides you in your work and also clarifies your aesthetic. However, keep in mind that copying someone else’s work and getting inspired by their work are two different things. Follow your photography idols, check out their best shots as much as you can and immerse yourself in the photos you find interesting.

Expanding your horizon means you need to continue your pursuit of learning photography skills by trying different things like if you mostly take the shots in one mode, try another one. If you spend more time on street photography, try your hand in nature photography. You don’t need to change your niche, it is just a way to develop different skills for example - trying low-light photography or nighttime photography will help you to understand the light better. Along with that, participate in different theme-based challenges and don’t be afraid of trying different genres of photography, it will definitely help you.
