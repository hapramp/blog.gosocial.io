Productivity is imperative in any profession. Justifying the quality and quantity of your work is as important as creating it. But attaining the ideal case of productivity is not always easy.

Art block is a very real and discouraging hurdle that plenty of artists face. Sometimes, you run out of innovative ideas and lose all the motivation you started off with. Apart from this, many artists struggle with time management, organization, and consistency. Encountering these difficulties as an artist is hard, but don’t be too disheartened.

So what are you supposed to do? How are you going to become a more productive artist? Well, worry not, as we have created a list of six effective ways that will help you achieve more productivity.

**1.  Learn the art of time management**

This is the first and most important step to be a more productive artist. At the beginning of every week, lay out your scheduled activities. Based on this, create a realistic timetable that allows space for working on more art projects.

While preparing this schedule, remember that things often take longer than they seem. Get the groove going and let your artistic flow sink in before you begin painting or sketching. This may take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour depending on your state of mind and health. So, instead of making a rigid, completely packed schedule, try to make it more doable.\
But, to be a more productive artist, you need to treat your art as a second job in itself. Devote as much time and effort as you can towards your art career and make it your priority.

**2.  Keep your workspace clean**

A clean workspace equals a more productive artist. You may have a full-fledged art studio, or a DIY art corner in a comfortable nook of your home. But, no matter how big or small, your work area is a crucial part of your art-making process.

Now, the point here is not to have a pristine corner that is always perfect and presentable. As an artist, you know that the mess you make as you produce more art is inevitable. This glorious, happy mess is a byproduct of your art, which you cannot avoid.

The key here is to have an environment that allows you to create more art and be a more productive artist. Here are a few tips to keep your workspace organized and clutter-free.

* Use labeled shelves and drawers to keep your art supplies in, for convenient access.
* Before you sit down to produce more art, make sure you have every item you might need, next to you. This way, you do not have to break your flow or slow down your momentum.
* Clean up after you have finished. Pick up the first item you see, and do not put it down until it is back in its designated place.

**3.    Take part in art challenges**

This is a super-fun way to increase your productivity. To be a more productive artist, you need to keep upgrading your skillset. What better way to do this, if not through the medium of challenges?

When you sit down to paint something, you have to make a lot of decisions. For example, you have to choose what to paint, the medium, the tools, and the style. This can be mentally tiring and take up a large part of your precious time. The best part about any art challenge is that it eliminates a lot of this “decision fatigue”. It sets the constraints and takes away the load of decision making. You only need to focus all your creative energy on making art.

One great art challenge is the [Watercolor Landscape challenge](https://getgosocial.app/blog/2020-05-16-Watercolor-landscape-Art-Challenge/). In this challenge, you have to paint one picture with watercolors every day. This is a fantastic way to learn how to control your brush strokes and paint with more confidence.

You can take [this challenge and many more](https://getgosocial.app/tags/challenge/) on [GoSocial](getgosocial.app), a social media app for artists and creators. The app lets you choose the duration of your challenge and start a “streak”.

Another cool aspect of art challenges is that they are social. You get to see brilliant interpretations of one single prompt, posted by many other artists taking the same challenges as you. Taking art challenges is the best way to be a more productive artist by creating more art on a daily basis.

If you are a new artist, challenges will help you learn to paint. By taking the challenges you set on a creative path, one defined by successors who have had similar experiences and have made similar mistakes. Challenges and prompts created by them coupled with their guidance will help you learn to paint faster.

**4.    Clear your mind**

Lingering thoughts and worries, add stress, and reduces focus. To become a more productive artist, you need to free your mind.

We know that this is easier said than done. You can’t completely drop every other thought on your mind. But, you can get rid of certain distractions. For instance, if you feel that checking social media hinders your flow, make it a point not to do so until you finish your art session. If you feel hungry or thirsty before you start, tend to those needs first so that you don’t have to pause your work to do so.

Some artists like to paint while listening to music. If you are one of them, you can use music to shut out all the noise. These simple tasks can go a long way in helping you be a more productive artist.

**5.     Just start creating**

There are times when you are overflowing with creative instincts. There are also times when you don’t feel up to the task of creating more art.

While many of us sit around and wait for a whiff of motivation, it's not always the best course of action. We need to realize that motivation doesn't always lead to action. In fact, most of the time, it is the other way around. Action leads to motivation.

Even if you don’t feel too keen on making art, starting on small tasks will help you out a lot. Think big, but start small. Your ultimate goal might be pretty intimidating, but that shouldn’t be your focus when you begin. Finish one small activity at a time, and work your way through each task at your own pace.

Before you know it, you’re almost done with the one big task that you had in mind. The best way to be a more productive artist is to start creating and get motivated as you go.

![GoSocial app says that to be a more productive artist, one must stop relying on burst of inspiration.](/img/don-t-wait-for-inspiration-to-strike.-start-creating..png "Don't wait for inspiration to strike. Start creating.")

**6.   Go easy on yourself**

In the process of trying to be a more productive artist, don’t forget to be kind to yourself. Learn to accept your shortcomings and do not beat yourself up over things you cannot control.

Remember to take breaks while you work. If you paint for 30 minutes, take a break for at least 5 minutes. Working long, uninterrupted hours can actually have an adverse effect on your productivity. So, make sure you take frequent breaks and know when to stop.

The best way to be a more efficient artist is knowing that you can’t spend too much time trying to perfect a piece of art. When you have created something good and you’ve spent a significant amount of time on it, wrap it up and relax.

The standards of productivity are different for different artists. No two artists are the same. You need to find the level that suits you and does not take love away from art. For an artist at the beginning of their journey, productivity may be defined by the speed at which they learn how to paint. While for a well-established artist productivity may come attached with some monetary value.It's great to want to become a more productive artist, but always remember why you started out. When you find what works best for you and keep practicing that, you will become a more efficient artist. Whatever be your way, remember to share your work and progress with your community. The best way to do this is by sharing your work on online platforms like GoSocial, Pinterest, and Instagram. Connect with art enthusiasts or share your work with other artists of your genre. These platforms will help you get the visibility that you are striving tirelessly for.
